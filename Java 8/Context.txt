Functionalities:
    1. Lambdas
    2. Functional Intefaces
    3. Method Interfaces
    4. Method References
    5. Collections improvement

WHY LAMDA?
    * Enables functional programming.
    * Readable and concise code.
    * Easy to write better APIs and libraries.
    * Enables support for parallel processing.

CODE IN OOP:
    * Everything is an object
    * All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects

LAMBDA SYNTAX:
    blockOfCode = () -> {...}   (OR)
    blockOfCode = () -> statement
    If your lambda having one statement, you could also remove return statement.

WAYS OF WRITING LAMBDA:
    * variable = () -> System.out.println("Hey");
    * variable = (int i) -> a*2; //no return needed.
    * variable = (int a, int b) -> { if(b==0) return 0; return a/b;}

DATATYPE OF LAMBDA VARIABLE:
    * Create a interface.
    * Create a method with same signature of lambda expression.
    * Mention interface name as datatype.
    * Method in interface should be 1.

CALLING LAMBDA FUNCION:
    * Lambda is not creating any object of the call for execution.
    * Normal interface required a class object to execute the function.

    interface Greeting{
        public void perform();
    }

CODE EXAMPLE:
    Both may look very similar, but they are different implementation.
    //Lambda
    Greeting greetLambda = () -> {System.out.println("Hello World");}

    (OR)
    //Interface
    Greeting greetInnerClass = new Greeting(){
        public void perform(){
            System.out.perform("Hello World");
        }
    }

TYPE INFERENCE:
    * Lambda will understand the type of the parameter in the interface.
    * So we can directly write lambda without datatype of the parameter.
    * Also if it is only one parameter, we can omit () in lambda syntax.
